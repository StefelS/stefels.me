                <p> <em>Computer Science Modified With Engineering major At Dartmouth College</em></p>
                <p> I am an junior at<a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/"> Dartmouth College </a> from Brooklyn, NY (Relocted to Jersey). 
                    I'll be graduating in 2024 with a degree in Computer Science modified
                    with Engineering Sciences. 
                    Outside of my major I've found an interest in astronomy, 
                    particularly the development of black holes and was lucky 
                    enough to do research with Dartmouth's physics department 
                    my freshman summer! I also enjoy playing sports and going 
                    to the gym and I am part of the layout team for Black 
                    Praxis, an all black, student-led group on campus geared 
                    towards promoting black life at Dartmouth.
