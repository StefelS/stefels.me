                    I am an undergrad at Dartmouth from Brooklyn, NY. I'll be graduating in 2024 with a degree in computer science  
                    and plan to take a 5th year for a BE in computer engineering.  
                     Outside of my major I've found an interest in astronomy, particularly the development of black holes and 
                     was lucky enough to do <a href= https://hickox.host.dartmouth.edu  style="text-decoration: none;" > <i> <strong> research </strong> </i> </a> with 
                     Dartmouth's physics department my freshman summer! I also enjoy playing sports and going to the gym and have recentlyjoined the layout team of <a href=https://blackpraxis.com/  style="text-decoration: none;"  > <i> <strong> Black Praxis </strong></i></a>, an all black,
                      student-led group on campus geared towards promoting black life at Dartmouth.
