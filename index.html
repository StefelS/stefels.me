                During my time at Dartmouth so far, I've gain proficient skills in python and java as well as suitable knowledge and use of data structures. Outside of comupter science
                one main area of interest is space! I was lucky enough to conduct research on black holes my freshman summer which as been a highlight of my college expereince thus far!
